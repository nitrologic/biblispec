Frustrated with broken links and modern models continuing habit of making shit up project
bibli creates a docs folder and adds the first wayback pdf.

[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC](/docs/vnedvac.pdf)

```
by John von Neumann

Michael D. Godfrey

Normally ﬁrst drafts are neither intended nor suitable for publication. This report is an exception.
It is a ﬁrst draft in the usual sense, but it contains a wealth of information, and it had a pervasive
inﬂuence when it was ﬁrst written. Most prominently, Alan Turing cites it, in his Proposal for the
Pilot ACE,* as the deﬁnitive source for understanding the nature and design of a general-purpose
digital computer.

After having inﬂuenced the ﬁrst generation of digital computer engineers, the von Neumann
report fell out of sight. There were at least two reasons for this: The report was hard to ﬁnd and
it was very hard to read.
```

## Array v Class

Difficulties remain when deciding in ordered array vs named class for spec collections.

A skirmish has errupted in machinespec.json that illustrates the two distinct styles:

```
	"spec": {
		"software-architecture": [{
			"name": "Transformers",
			"introduced": "Vaswani et al., Google Research",
			"year": 2017,

...

		}],
		"video-game":{
			"Speed Race": {
				"developer": "Taito",

```

## Vai Syllabary

The Vai syllabary originated in the 1830s through Momolu Duwalu Bukele’s innovative efforts.

Its creation was a remarkable act of cultural and intellectual agency, transforming the Vai into one of the few African peoples with an indigenous writing system not based on Latin or Arabic scripts. The script’s enduring use and standardization underscore its significance as a symbol of Vai identity and resilience.

## Cherokee Syllabary

The Cherokee syllabary represents a remarkable achievement in linguistic innovation and cultural preservation:

# ᎠᎡᎢᎣᎤᎥᎦᎧᎨᎩᎪᎫᎬᎭᎮᎯᎰᎱᎲᎳᎴᎵᎶᎷᎸᎹᎺᎻᎼᎽᎾᎿᏀᏁᏂᏃᏄᏅᏆᏇᏈᏉᏊᏋᏌᏍᏎᏏᏐᏑᏒᏓᏔᏕᏖᏗᏘᏙᏚᏛᏜᏝᏞᏟᏠᏡᏢᏣᏤᏥᏦᏧᏨᏩᏪᏫᏬᏭᏮᏯᏀᏁᏂᏃᏄᏅᏆᏇᏈᏉᏊᏋᏌᏍᏎᏏᏐᏑᏒᏓᏔᏕᏖᏗᏘᏙᏚᏛ

### Usage

- Created by Sequoyah (also known as George Gist), a Cherokee silversmith who was monolingual in Cherokee
- Developed independently without knowledge of how other writing systems worked
- One of the few writing systems created by a single person in recorded history

### Basis

- 85 characters representing syllables (not individual sounds like alphabets)
- Based on Cherokee spoken language structure where syllables are the natural units
- Incorporates some modified Latin letters but with completely different phonetic values
- Each symbol represents a consonant-vowel combination or standalone vowel

### Notes

- Transformed Cherokee society almost overnight - literacy rates soared
- Enabled the Cherokee Nation to publish newspapers, legal documents, and literature
- The Cherokee Phoenix (1828) was the first Native American newspaper
- Used for official Cherokee Nation documents and the Cherokee Constitution
- Helped maintain Cherokee language during periods of forced assimilation
- Used to preserve traditional stories, songs, and cultural knowledge
- Today still used in Cherokee language education and cultural programs
- Symbol of Cherokee intellectual sovereignty and resistance to cultural erasure

> This represents not just a writing system, but a powerful symbol of indigenous innovation and cultural resilience.

## Ogham Script

Ogham, an ancient Irish script, embodies the mystique of Celtic heritage and early written communication:

Attributed to the mythical figure Ogma, the Celtic god of eloquence and learning. Primarily inscribed on stone monuments in Ireland and western Britain (4th–9th centuries CE). Known as the "Celtic tree alphabet" due to letter names tied to trees and nature

# ᚁ ᚂ ᚃ ᚄ ᚅ 
# ᚆ ᚇ ᚈ ᚉ ᚊ 
# ᚋ ᚌ ᚍ ᚎ ᚏ

# ᚐ ᚑ ᚒ ᚓ ᚔ
# ᚕ ᚖ ᚗ ᚘ ᚙ ᚚ


### Usage

* Old Irish inscriptions, memorials, boundary markers, Ogham stones
* Reflects early Celtic oral traditions, linking language to the natural world
* Revived in modern times for neo-pagan practices, art, and Irish cultural identity
* Inspires contemporary designs in jewelry, tattoos, and calligraphy

### Basis

* 20 primary letters (feda) in four aicmí (groups of five), with strokes or notches relative to a central line (flesc)
* Five additional forfeda for diphthongs and later sounds
* Typically read bottom-to-top on stone edges, though manuscripts show horizontal writing
* Represents consonants and vowels, tailored to the phonetics of Old Irish

## Notes

* Preserves early Irish language and genealogy, with ~400 surviving inscriptions
* Documented in medieval texts like the Ogam Tract in the Book of Ballymote
* Symbolizes Celtic resilience and connection to nature in modern Irish culture
* Used in education and cultural programs to teach about ancient Irish heritage
* Unicode ImplementationThe Ogham block (U+1680-U+169F) includes:
* 20 primary letters (ᚁ–ᚔ) for Old Irish phonemes
* Five forfeda (ᚕ–ᚚ) for extended sounds

> Ogham stands as a testament to Ireland’s ancient literary tradition, bridging mythology, nature, and language.
