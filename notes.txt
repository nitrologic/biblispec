you’d use standard citation formats (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) 
that rely on the author’s name, book title, publisher, and publication year. For example:

MLA: Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. Harcourt, 1925.
APA: Woolf, V. (1925). Mrs. Dalloway. Harcourt.
These formats don’t require ORCIDs, and most style guides don’t expect them unless the author’s ORCID is explicitly relevant (e.g., in a research database).

The Vai script (ꕙꔤ) is one of Africa’s few indigenous writing systems developed
independently of European or Arabic influence. Here’s a deep dive into its history, materials, and
modern usage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Cultural & Historical Background
- Origin: Created circa 1833 by Momolu Duwalu Bukele, a Vai scholar from
Liberia.
- Inspiration: Likely influenced by:
  - Dream visions (Bukele claimed divine inspiration)
  - Indigenous symbols (e.g., traditional Vai pictograms)
  - Limited exposure to Arabic (via Muslim traders) and Latin scripts (via missionaries)
- Status: One of the few successful indigenous scripts still in use today.

Mythology & Significance
- The script was initially taught in secrecy, as it was considered sacred.
- Linked to Poro societies (a West African secret society) for record-keeping.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Materials & Traditional Usage
Writing Surfaces
- Early Forms:
  - Clay tablets (for practice)
  - Wooden boards (for formal records)
  - Leaves & bark (temporary notes)
- Modern Forms:
  - Paper & digital (since the 20th century)

Tools
- Stylus: Sharpened sticks or metal tools for engraving.
- Ink: Natural dyes (e.g., charcoal, plant-based pigments).

Traditional Uses
✔ Personal correspondence (letters, contracts)
✔ Religious texts (Poro society records)
✔ Historical documentation (genealogies, treaties)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Modern Usage & Challenges
Current Applications
- Education: Taught in some Liberian and Sierra Leonean schools.
- Media: Used in newspapers, radio, and social media (limited but growing).
- Technology: Supported in Unicode (since 2005) and available on some digital keyboards.

Challenges
⚠ Limited Literacy: Only ~10-20% of Vai speakers can read/write the script.
⚠ Font Support: Many devices lack proper Vai font rendering.
⚠ Latin Competition: Many Vai speakers use the Latin alphabet for convenience.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Linguistic Structure
- Type: Syllabary (each symbol = consonant + vowel).
- Characters: ~200 core syllables + numbers + punctuation.
- Direction: Left-to-right (unlike Arabic-influenced scripts).

Example Words
┌─────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐
│  Vai Script │  Pronunciation │  Meaning      │
├─────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤
│  **ꕙꔤ**      │  *Vai*        │  "Vai people" │
│  **ꕞꕌꔳ**     │  *Lāhi*       │  "God"        │
│  **ꖷꖬ**      │  *Sɔ̀*         │  "house"      │
└─────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. Preservation Efforts
- UNESCO: Recognized as part of Liberia’s intangible cultural heritage.
- Digital Revival:
  - Fonts: Noto Sans Vai, Ebrima (Windows).
  - Keyboards: Mobile/desktop input methods available.
  - Wikipedia: Vai Wikipedia project in development.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Conclusion
The Vai script is a testament to African ingenuity, blending indigenous tradition with
functional literacy. While facing challenges from Latin script dominance, it remains a vibrant
cultural symbol and is gradually adapting to the digital age.

The Egyptian Hieroglyphs Unicode block has 100 standardized variants defined to specify rotated signs.[3][4] (Rotation is clockwise when the text is rendered from left-to-right but counter-clockwise if the text is mirrored right-to-left.)[3]

Variation selector-1 (VS1) (U+FE00) can be used to rotate 40 signs by 90°:
U+13091, 1310F, 1311C, 13121, 13127, 13139, 131A0, 131B1, 131B8–131B9, 131CB, 131E0, 131F9–131FA, 1327B, 1327F, 13285, 1328C, 132AA, 132CB, 132DC, 132E7, 13307, 1331B, 13322, 1333C, 13377–13378, 13399–1339A, 133D3, 133E5, 133E7, 133F2, 133F5–133F6, 13416, 13419–1341A and 13423
VS2 (U+FE01) can be used to rotate 22 signs by 180°:
U+13093, 13132, 13139, 13187, 131B1, 131EE, 131F8–131FA, 13257, 1327F, 132A4, 13308, 13312–13314, 1331B, 13321–13322, 13331, 133E8 and 13419
VS3 (U+FE02) can be used to rotate 36 signs by 270°:
U+13117, 13139, 13183, 131A0, 131BA, 131EE, 13216, 1327B, 132A4, 132E7, 132E9, 132F8, 132FD, 13302–13303, 13310–13314, 1331C, 13321, 13331, 1334A, 13361, 13373, 1337D, 13385, 133AF–133B0, 133BF, 133DB, 133DD, 13419, 1342C and 1342E
VS4 (U+FE03) can be used to rotate 1 sign by approximately 30°:
U+13338
VS7 (U+FE06) can be used to rotate 1 sign by approximately 320°:
U+13338

from https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1997/97266-n1636.pdf :

Signs like BEGIN CARTOUCHE and END CARTOUCHE should be understood to function exactly as do LEFT
PARENTHESIS and RIGHT PARENTHESIS (that, is, they take bi-directional context into account). Rendering
should draw a continuous line between the two characters.
