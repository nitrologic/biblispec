It’s 95% perfect — only two tiny issues that are worth fixing for consistency and accuracy:

Scallion pancake (Cong you bing)
This one is made from a stiff dough that’s rolled, layered with oil and scallions, and then pan-fried — it is not batter-based.
Almost every culinary source (and Chinese cooks themselves) firmly places it with laminated flatbreads (closer to paratha or msemen) rather than the pourable-batter crepe/pancake family.
→ Remove it from this list (or move it back to your flatbread section).
Msemen (with batter variant)
Traditional msemen is 100% a folded, oil-laminated dough (again, very close to South-Asian paratha or Moroccan rghaif).
There is no widespread “batter variant” of msemen — the rare spongy versions people sometimes call “msemen batter” are actually a different item (closer to baghrir or a very loose mkhamer).
→ Remove or rename this entry to avoid confusion. If you want a Maghrebi spongy pancake, just keep Baghrir (which is correct and iconic).

Everything else is spot-on and beautifully ordered from east to west.

**Potential Improvements in `biblispec.json` Alchemy Sections**
*Similar to the salt disambiguation (variants across blocks like Pantry vs. Compounds), here are targeted enhancements based on Unicode 15.1 official names , historical sources (e.g., Paracelsus, Basil Valentine ), and proposal notes (L2/07-025 ). Focus: duplicates/redundancies, contextual variants, and precision.*

---

### **1. Vitriols (Multiple Variants Across Sections)**
**Issue:** Like salts, vitriols (sulfates) have general & specific forms. Pantry has "Vitriol, Blue Vitriol" (U+1F716–U+1F717: VITRIOL, VITRIOL-2). Compounds has "White Vitriol, Blue Vitriol, Green Vitriol" (U+1F730–U+1F732). Unicode notes VITRIOL-2 as variant; historical texts (Valentine) distinguish by color/metal (e.g., blue = copper sulfate, green = iron, white = zinc). Risk: Ambiguity if "Blue Vitriol" repeats without context.

**Suggestions:**
- **Pantry (`🜐🜚`):** Keep general: "Vitriol, Blue Vitriol (Copper)" – Add metal for specificity.
- **Compounds (`🜨🜼`):** Refine to: "...White Vitriol (Zinc), Blue Vitriol (Copper), Green Vitriol (Iron)..." – Matches historical (Paracelsus links to metals ) & Unicode cross-refs.
- **Why?** Prevents overlap; aligns with proposal emphasizing metal-based compounds . Add `"variants": {"U+1F716": "General Vitriol", "U+1F717": "Vitriol Variant"}`.

---

### **2. Salt-Related Compounds (Overlaps with General Salt)**
**Issue:** Beyond rock salts, compounds include salt variants (e.g., U+1F72A 🜪 ROCK SALT = sal gemmae ; U+1F714 🜔 SALT general). Your "Regenerated Salt" for 🜪 is good, but U+1F726 (SALT OF COPPER ANTIMONIATE), U+1F727 (SUBLIMATE OF SALT OF COPPER), U+1F72D (SALT OF ANTIMONY = cinnabar ) tie back to salt (cross-ref U+1F714). Historical: Paracelsus/Valentine use "sal" for fixed salts post-process .

**Suggestions:**
- **Compounds (`🜨🜼`):** For later entries (if present; your list ends at Tutty U+1F73C), ensure: "Salt of Copper Antimonate (Fixed)", "Sublimate of Copper Salt". Current "Sal Ammoniac" (U+1F728, correct as ammonium chloride ) is fine, but add alias: "Sal Ammoniac (Ammonium Chloride)".
- **Pantry (`🜐🜚`):** "Salt" (U+1F714) → "Common Salt" or "Fixed Salt" to distinguish from rock variants.
- **Why?** Unicode highlights sublimate/salt cross-refs ; avoids conflating raw (Pantry) vs. processed (Compounds). Proposal notes many salt variants .

---

### **3. Metals (Planetary & Variant Names)**
**Issue:** `🜛🜧` lists modern names (e.g., "Platinum" U+1F723, "Arsenic" U+1F724), but historical alchemists used planetary (e.g., Mercury ☿ U+263F, but block has 🜝 MERCURY; Iron as "Mars" ). Bismuth/Zinc (16th-century discoveries) disrupted associations . Unicode: Some redundant with misc symbols (e.g., gold 🜚 vs. ☉).

**Suggestions:**
- Add `"historical": {"🜜": "Iron (Mars)", "🜝": "Mercury (Quicksilver)", "🜟": "Lead (Saturn)"}` – Ties to tria prima (Paracelsus: salt/mercury/sulfur ).
- For 🜧 (POTASH): Already "Potash"; confirm as "Alkali of Tartar" (Valentine ).
- **Why?** Wikipedia/Unicode note variants (e.g., early ☿=tin ); enhances scholarly use .

---

### **4. Processes & Operations (Fixation Duplicates)**
**Issue:** `🝀🝔` has "Fix, Fixation (2)" (U+1F748 FIX, U+1F74F FIXATION) – Good disambig., but Unicode/proposal notes processes like SUBLIME (U+1F741), DISTILL (U+1F760) have variants (e.g., stratum super stratum U+1F75C ). `🝕🝣` "Distil" correct, but historical magnum opus links (e.g., Pernety: Fixation=Gemini ).

**Suggestions:**
- **Operations (`🝀🝔`):** "Fix (Initial), Fixation (Final)" – Or add Zodiac: "Fixation (Gemini)".
- **Process (`🝕🝣`):** For "Slow-Digest" (U+1F762), note variant "Digestion" (U+1F746 in ops) – Cross-ref to avoid overlap.
- **Why?** Proposal emphasizes process variants ; Wikipedia lists 12-step opus with Zodiac .

---

### **5. Essences (Spirit Variants & Aqua)**
**Issue:** `🝤🝳` good (e.g., "Spirit of Wine" U+1F764), but aquas (Aqua Fortis U+1F76A, Aqua Regia U+1F76B ) have variants (🜅–🜇 ). Historical: "Aqua vitae" = spirit of wine, but overlaps with essences.

**Suggestions:**
- Add aliases: "Aqua Fortis (Nitric Acid)", "Aqua Regia (Nitro-Hydrochloric Acid)" – Per Wikipedia .
- **Why?** Unicode cross-refs aquas to acids/vinegar ; clarifies chemical equiv.

---

### **6. General Enhancements (Block-Wide)**
- **Duplicates/Redundancies:** Unicode notes many symbols redundant (e.g., with misc symbols ); add `"cross_refs": ["U+2600 for some elements"]`.
- **Historical Sources:** Add per section: `"sources": ["Basil Valentine (1671)", "Paracelsus", "Unicode Prop L2/07-025"]` .
- **Wu Xing (`㊊㊐`):** Non-alchemy, but cosmology link; consider `"context": "Wu Xing (Chinese Five Elements + Celestial")` – Accurate, but separate if expanding.
- **Range/Codepoints:** All match Unicode 15.1 ; no errata found (TR51 emoji-focused ).
- **Font Support:** Note: Few fonts support full block ; suggest "Symbola" .

---

**Priority:** High for vitriols/salts (like your salt fix); medium for processes/essences. These prevent ambiguity in multi-block use, align with historical variants (3,695+ symbols, many omitted ), and boost scholarly value .

**Next Steps:** Apply vitriol disambig. first? Or full patched JSON? Your call – collaborative precision wins.

you’d use standard citation formats (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago)
that rely on the author’s name, book title, publisher, and publication year. For example:

MLA: Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. Harcourt, 1925.
APA: Woolf, V. (1925). Mrs. Dalloway. Harcourt.
These formats don’t require ORCIDs, and most style guides don’t expect them unless the author’s ORCID is explicitly relevant (e.g., in a research database).

The Vai script (ꕙꔤ) is one of Africa’s few indigenous writing systems developed
independently of European or Arabic influence. Here’s a deep dive into its history, materials, and
modern usage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Cultural & Historical Background
- Origin: Created circa 1833 by Momolu Duwalu Bukele, a Vai scholar from
Liberia.
- Inspiration: Likely influenced by:
	- Dream visions (Bukele claimed divine inspiration)
	- Indigenous symbols (e.g., traditional Vai pictograms)
	- Limited exposure to Arabic (via Muslim traders) and Latin scripts (via missionaries)
- Status: One of the few successful indigenous scripts still in use today.

Mythology & Significance
- The script was initially taught in secrecy, as it was considered sacred.
- Linked to Poro societies (a West African secret society) for record-keeping.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Materials & Traditional Usage
Writing Surfaces
- Early Forms:
	- Clay tablets (for practice)
	- Wooden boards (for formal records)
	- Leaves & bark (temporary notes)
- Modern Forms:
	- Paper & digital (since the 20th century)

Tools
- Stylus: Sharpened sticks or metal tools for engraving.
- Ink: Natural dyes (e.g., charcoal, plant-based pigments).

Traditional Uses
✔ Personal correspondence (letters, contracts)
✔ Religious texts (Poro society records)
✔ Historical documentation (genealogies, treaties)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Modern Usage & Challenges
Current Applications
- Education: Taught in some Liberian and Sierra Leonean schools.
- Media: Used in newspapers, radio, and social media (limited but growing).
- Technology: Supported in Unicode (since 2005) and available on some digital keyboards.

Challenges
⚠ Limited Literacy: Only ~10-20% of Vai speakers can read/write the script.
⚠ Font Support: Many devices lack proper Vai font rendering.
⚠ Latin Competition: Many Vai speakers use the Latin alphabet for convenience.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Linguistic Structure
- Type: Syllabary (each symbol = consonant + vowel).
- Characters: ~200 core syllables + numbers + punctuation.
- Direction: Left-to-right (unlike Arabic-influenced scripts).

Example Words
┌─────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐
│  Vai Script │  Pronunciation │  Meaning      │
├─────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤
│  **ꕙꔤ**      │  *Vai*        │  "Vai people" │
│  **ꕞꕌꔳ**     │  *Lāhi*       │  "God"        │
│  **ꖷꖬ**      │  *Sɔ̀*         │  "house"      │
└─────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. Preservation Efforts
- UNESCO: Recognized as part of Liberia’s intangible cultural heritage.
- Digital Revival:
	- Fonts: Noto Sans Vai, Ebrima (Windows).
	- Keyboards: Mobile/desktop input methods available.
	- Wikipedia: Vai Wikipedia project in development.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Conclusion
The Vai script is a testament to African ingenuity, blending indigenous tradition with
functional literacy. While facing challenges from Latin script dominance, it remains a vibrant
cultural symbol and is gradually adapting to the digital age.

The Egyptian Hieroglyphs Unicode block has 100 standardized variants defined to specify rotated signs.[3][4] (Rotation is clockwise when the text is rendered from left-to-right but counter-clockwise if the text is mirrored right-to-left.)[3]

Variation selector-1 (VS1) (U+FE00) can be used to rotate 40 signs by 90°:
U+13091, 1310F, 1311C, 13121, 13127, 13139, 131A0, 131B1, 131B8–131B9, 131CB, 131E0, 131F9–131FA, 1327B, 1327F, 13285, 1328C, 132AA, 132CB, 132DC, 132E7, 13307, 1331B, 13322, 1333C, 13377–13378, 13399–1339A, 133D3, 133E5, 133E7, 133F2, 133F5–133F6, 13416, 13419–1341A and 13423
VS2 (U+FE01) can be used to rotate 22 signs by 180°:
U+13093, 13132, 13139, 13187, 131B1, 131EE, 131F8–131FA, 13257, 1327F, 132A4, 13308, 13312–13314, 1331B, 13321–13322, 13331, 133E8 and 13419
VS3 (U+FE02) can be used to rotate 36 signs by 270°:
U+13117, 13139, 13183, 131A0, 131BA, 131EE, 13216, 1327B, 132A4, 132E7, 132E9, 132F8, 132FD, 13302–13303, 13310–13314, 1331C, 13321, 13331, 1334A, 13361, 13373, 1337D, 13385, 133AF–133B0, 133BF, 133DB, 133DD, 13419, 1342C and 1342E
VS4 (U+FE03) can be used to rotate 1 sign by approximately 30°:
U+13338
VS7 (U+FE06) can be used to rotate 1 sign by approximately 320°:
U+13338

from https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1997/97266-n1636.pdf :

Signs like BEGIN CARTOUCHE and END CARTOUCHE should be understood to function exactly as do LEFT
PARENTHESIS and RIGHT PARENTHESIS (that, is, they take bi-directional context into account). Rendering
should draw a continuous line between the two characters.
