The Egyptian Hieroglyphs Unicode block has 100 standardized variants defined to specify rotated signs.[3][4] (Rotation is clockwise when the text is rendered from left-to-right but counter-clockwise if the text is mirrored right-to-left.)[3]

Variation selector-1 (VS1) (U+FE00) can be used to rotate 40 signs by 90°:
U+13091, 1310F, 1311C, 13121, 13127, 13139, 131A0, 131B1, 131B8–131B9, 131CB, 131E0, 131F9–131FA, 1327B, 1327F, 13285, 1328C, 132AA, 132CB, 132DC, 132E7, 13307, 1331B, 13322, 1333C, 13377–13378, 13399–1339A, 133D3, 133E5, 133E7, 133F2, 133F5–133F6, 13416, 13419–1341A and 13423
VS2 (U+FE01) can be used to rotate 22 signs by 180°:
U+13093, 13132, 13139, 13187, 131B1, 131EE, 131F8–131FA, 13257, 1327F, 132A4, 13308, 13312–13314, 1331B, 13321–13322, 13331, 133E8 and 13419
VS3 (U+FE02) can be used to rotate 36 signs by 270°:
U+13117, 13139, 13183, 131A0, 131BA, 131EE, 13216, 1327B, 132A4, 132E7, 132E9, 132F8, 132FD, 13302–13303, 13310–13314, 1331C, 13321, 13331, 1334A, 13361, 13373, 1337D, 13385, 133AF–133B0, 133BF, 133DB, 133DD, 13419, 1342C and 1342E
VS4 (U+FE03) can be used to rotate 1 sign by approximately 30°:
U+13338
VS7 (U+FE06) can be used to rotate 1 sign by approximately 320°:
U+13338

from https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1997/97266-n1636.pdf :

Signs like BEGIN CARTOUCHE and END CARTOUCHE should be understood to function exactly as do LEFT
PARENTHESIS and RIGHT PARENTHESIS (that, is, they take bi-directional context into account). Rendering
should draw a continuous line between the two characters.
